# Angular 2 Testing Quickstart
Angular 2 Testing Quickstart breaks unit testing in Angular 2 down into bite-size pieces. One of the hardest parts of testing is actually getting started, and that is exactly what you will do with this repo.

Check out the code that goes with this guide [here](https://github.com/onehungrymind/angular-testing-examples).

## Getting started
To run the guide locally, you will need Ruby [installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on your system.

Once ruby is installed, run the following in the root directory of this project:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```
